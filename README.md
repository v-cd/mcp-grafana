A [Model Context Protocol][mcp] (MCP) server for Grafana.

This provides access to your Grafana instance and the surrounding ecosystem.

## Quick Start

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Add the following to your MCP client configuration (e.g. Claude Desktop, Cursor):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-grafana"],
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "<your service account token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Grafana Cloud, replace `GRAFANA_URL` with your instance URL (e.g. `https://myinstance.grafana.net`). See [Usage](#usage) for more installation options including Docker, binary, and Helm.

## Requirements

- **Grafana version 9.0 or later** is required for full functionality. Some features, particularly datasource-related operations, may not work correctly with earlier versions due to missing API endpoints.

## Features

_The following features are currently available in MCP server. This list is for informational purposes only and does not represent a roadmap or commitment to future features._

### Dashboards

- **Search for dashboards:** Find dashboards by title or other metadata
- **Get dashboard by UID:** Retrieve full dashboard details using its unique identifier. _Warning: Large dashboards can consume significant context window space._
- **Get dashboard summary:** Get a compact overview of a dashboard including title, panel count, panel types, variables, and metadata without the full JSON to minimize context window usage
- **Get dashboard property:** Extract specific parts of a dashboard using JSONPath expressions (e.g., `$.title`, `$.panels[*].title`) to fetch only needed data and reduce context window consumption
- **Update or create a dashboard:** Modify existing dashboards or create new ones. _Warning: Requires full dashboard JSON which can consume large amounts of context window space._
- **Patch dashboard:** Apply specific changes to a dashboard without requiring the full JSON, significantly reducing context window usage for targeted modifications
- **Get panel queries and datasource info:** Get the title, query string, and datasource information (including UID and type, if available) from every panel in a dashboard

### Run Panel Query

#### Context Window Management

The dashboard tools now include several strategies to manage context window usage effectively ([issue #101](https://github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana/issues/101)):

- **Use `get_dashboard_summary`** for dashboard overview and planning modifications
- **Use `get_dashboard_property`** with JSONPath when you only need specific dashboard parts
- **Avoid `get_dashboard_by_uid`** unless you specifically need the complete dashboard JSON

The list of tools is configurable, so you can choose which tools you want to make available to the MCP client.
This is useful if you don't use certain functionality or if you don't want to take up too much of the context window.
To disable a category of tools, use the `--disable-<category>` flag when starting the server. For example, to disable
the OnCall tools, use `--disable-oncall`, or to disable navigation deeplink generation, use `--disable-navigation`.


#### RBAC Permissions

Each tool requires specific RBAC permissions to function properly. When creating a service account for the MCP server, ensure it has the necessary permissions based on which tools you plan to use. The permissions listed are the minimum required actions - you may also need appropriate scopes (e.g., `datasources:*`, `dashboards:*`, `folders:*`) depending on your use case.

Tip: If you're not familiar with Grafana RBAC or you want a quicker, simpler setup instead of configuring many granular scopes, you can assign a built-in role such as `Editor` to the service account. The `Editor` role grants broad read/write access that will allow most MCP server operations; it is less granular (and therefore less restrictive) than manually-applied scopes, so use it only when convenience is more important than strict least-privilege access.

**Note:** Grafana Incident and Sift tools use basic Grafana roles instead of fine-grained RBAC permissions:
- **Viewer role:** Required for read-only operations (list incidents, get investigations)
- **Editor role:** Required for write operations (create incidents, modify investigations)

For more information about Grafana RBAC, see the [official documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/).

#### RBAC Scopes

Scopes define the specific resources that permissions apply to. Each action requires both the appropriate permission and scope combination.

**Common Scope Patterns:**

- **Broad access:** Use `*` wildcards for organization-wide access

  - `datasources:*` - Access to all datasources
  - `dashboards:*` - Access to all dashboards
  - `folders:*` - Access to all folders
  - `teams:*` - Access to all teams

- **Limited access:** Use specific UIDs or IDs to restrict access to individual resources
  - `datasources:uid:prometheus-uid` - Access only to a specific Prometheus datasource
  - `dashboards:uid:abc123` - Access only to dashboard with UID `abc123`
  - `folders:uid:xyz789` - Access only to folder with UID `xyz789`
  - `teams:id:5` - Access only to team with ID `5`
  - `global.users:id:123` - Access only to user with ID `123`

**Examples:**

- **Full MCP server access:** Grant broad permissions for all tools

  ```
  datasources:* (datasources:read, datasources:query)
  dashboards:* (dashboards:read, dashboards:create, dashboards:write)
  folders:* (for dashboard creation and alert rules)
  teams:* (teams:read)
  global.users:* (users:read)
  ```

- **Limited datasource access:** Only query specific Prometheus and Loki instances

  ```
  datasources:uid:prometheus-prod (datasources:query)
  datasources:uid:loki-prod (datasources:query)
  ```

- **Dashboard-specific access:** Read only specific dashboards
  ```
  dashboards:uid:monitoring-dashboard (dashboards:read)
  dashboards:uid:alerts-dashboard (dashboards:read)
  ```

_* Disabled by default. Add category to `--enabled-tools` to enable._

## CLI Flags Reference

The `mcp-grafana` binary supports various command-line flags for configuration:

**Transport Options:**
- `-t, --transport`: Transport type (`stdio`, `sse`, or `streamable-http`) - default: `stdio`
- `--address`: The host and port for SSE/streamable-http server - default: `localhost:8000`
- `--base-path`: Base path for the SSE/streamable-http server
- `--endpoint-path`: Endpoint path for the streamable-http server - default: `/`

**Debug and Logging:**
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode for detailed HTTP request/response logging
- `--log-level`: Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) - default: `info`

**Observability:**
- `--metrics`: Enable Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics`
- `--metrics-address`: Separate address for metrics server (e.g., `:9090`). If empty, metrics are served on the main server

**Tool Configuration:**
- `--enabled-tools`: Comma-separated list of enabled categories - default: all categories except `admin`, to enable admin tools, add `admin` to the list (e.g., `"search,datasource,...,admin"`)
- `--max-loki-log-limit`: Maximum number of log lines returned per `query_loki_logs` call - default: `100`. Note: Set this at least 1 below Loki's server-side `max_entries_limit_per_query` to allow truncation detection (the tool requests `limit+1` internally to detect if more data exists).
- `--max-victorialogs-log-limit`: Maximum number of log lines returned per `query_victorialogs_logs` call - default: `100`. This limit is independent of `--max-loki-log-limit`.
- `--disable-search`: Disable search tools
- `--disable-datasource`: Disable datasource tools
- `--disable-incident`: Disable incident tools
- `--disable-prometheus`: Disable prometheus tools
- `--disable-write`: Disable write tools (create/update operations)
- `--disable-loki`: Disable loki tools
- `--disable-elasticsearch`: Disable elasticsearch tools
- `--disable-alerting`: Disable alerting tools
- `--disable-dashboard`: Disable dashboard tools
- `--disable-oncall`: Disable oncall tools
- `--disable-asserts`: Disable asserts tools
- `--disable-sift`: Disable sift tools
- `--disable-admin`: Disable admin tools
- `--disable-pyroscope`: Disable pyroscope tools
- `--disable-navigation`: Disable navigation tools
- `--disable-rendering`: Disable rendering tools (panel/dashboard image export)
- `--disable-cloudwatch`: Disable CloudWatch tools
- `--disable-examples`: Disable query examples tools
- `--disable-clickhouse`: Disable ClickHouse tools
- `--disable-searchlogs`: Disable search_logs tool
- `--disable-runpanelquery`: Disable run panel query tools
- `--disable-victorialogs`: Disable VictoriaLogs tools

### Read-Only Mode

The `--disable-write` flag provides a way to run the MCP server in read-only mode, preventing any write operations to your Grafana instance. This is useful for scenarios where you want to provide safe, read-only access such as:

- Using service accounts with limited read-only permissions
- Providing AI assistants with observability data without modification capabilities
- Running in production environments where write access should be restricted
- Testing and development scenarios where you want to prevent accidental modifications

When `--disable-write` is enabled, the following write operations are disabled:

**Dashboard Tools:**
- `update_dashboard`

**Folder Tools:**
- `create_folder`

**Incident Tools:**
- `create_incident`
- `add_activity_to_incident`

**Alerting Tools:**
- `alerting_manage_rules` (create, update, delete operations)

**Annotation Tools:**
- `create_annotation`
- `update_annotation`

**Sift Tools:**
- `find_error_pattern_logs` (creates investigations)
- `find_slow_requests` (creates investigations)

All read operations remain available, allowing you to query dashboards, run PromQL/LogQL queries, list resources, and retrieve data.

**Client TLS Configuration (for Grafana connections):**
- `--tls-cert-file`: Path to TLS certificate file for client authentication
- `--tls-key-file`: Path to TLS private key file for client authentication
- `--tls-ca-file`: Path to TLS CA certificate file for server verification
- `--tls-skip-verify`: Skip TLS certificate verification (insecure)

**Server TLS Configuration (streamable-http transport only):**
- `--server.tls-cert-file`: Path to TLS certificate file for server HTTPS
- `--server.tls-key-file`: Path to TLS private key file for server HTTPS

## Usage

This MCP server works with both local Grafana instances and Grafana Cloud. For Grafana Cloud, use your instance URL (e.g., `https://myinstance.grafana.net`) instead of `http://localhost:3000` in the configuration examples below.

1. If using service account token authentication, create a service account in Grafana with enough permissions to use the tools you want to use,
   generate a service account token, and copy it to the clipboard for use in the configuration file.
   Follow the [Grafana service account documentation][service-account] for details on creating service account tokens.
   Tip: If you're not comfortable configuring fine-grained RBAC scopes, a simpler (but less restrictive) option is to assign the built-in `Editor` role to the service account. This grants broad read/write access that covers most MCP server operations — use it when convenience outweighs strict least-privilege requirements.

   > **Note:** The environment variable `GRAFANA_API_KEY` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please migrate to using `GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` instead. The old variable name will continue to work for backward compatibility but will show deprecation warnings.

### Multi-Organization Support
 
You can specify which organization to interact with using either:

- **Environment variable:** Set `GRAFANA_ORG_ID` to the numeric organization ID
- **HTTP header:** Set `X-Grafana-Org-Id` when using SSE or streamable HTTP transports (header takes precedence over environment variable - meaning you can set a default org as well).

When an organization ID is provided, the MCP server will set the `X-Grafana-Org-Id` header on all requests to Grafana, ensuring that operations are performed within the specified organization context.

**Example with organization ID:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana": {
      "command": "mcp-grafana",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "GRAFANA_USERNAME": "<your username>",
        "GRAFANA_PASSWORD": "<your password>",
        "GRAFANA_ORG_ID": "2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom HTTP Headers

You can add arbitrary HTTP headers to all Grafana API requests using the `GRAFANA_EXTRA_HEADERS` environment variable. The value should be a JSON object mapping header names to values.

**Example with custom headers:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana": {
      "command": "mcp-grafana",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "<your token>",
        "GRAFANA_EXTRA_HEADERS": "{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"custom-value\", \"X-Tenant-ID\": \"tenant-123\"}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. You have several options to install `mcp-grafana`:

   - **uvx (recommended)**: If you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed, no extra setup is needed — `uvx` will automatically download and run the server:

     ```bash
     uvx mcp-grafana
     ```

   - **Docker image**: Use the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub.

     **Important**: The Docker image's entrypoint is configured to run the MCP server in SSE mode by default, but most users will want to use STDIO mode for direct integration with AI assistants like Claude Desktop:

     1. **STDIO Mode**: For stdio mode you must explicitly override the default with `-t stdio` and include the `-i` flag to keep stdin open:

     ```bash
     docker pull grafana/mcp-grafana
     # For local Grafana:
     docker run --rm -i -e GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000 -e GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your service account token> grafana/mcp-grafana -t stdio
     # For Grafana Cloud:
     docker run --rm -i -e GRAFANA_URL=https://myinstance.grafana.net -e GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your service account token> grafana/mcp-grafana -t stdio
     ```

     2. **SSE Mode**: In this mode, the server runs as an HTTP server that clients connect to. You must expose port 8000 using the `-p` flag:

     ```bash
     docker pull grafana/mcp-grafana
     docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000 -e GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your service account token> grafana/mcp-grafana
     ```

     3. **Streamable HTTP Mode**: In this mode, the server operates as an independent process that can handle multiple client connections. You must expose port 8000 using the `-p` flag: For this mode you must explicitly override the default with `-t streamable-http`

     ```bash
     docker pull grafana/mcp-grafana
     docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000 -e GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your service account token> grafana/mcp-grafana -t streamable-http
     ```

     For HTTPS streamable HTTP mode with server TLS certificates:

     ```bash
     docker pull grafana/mcp-grafana
     docker run --rm -p 8443:8443 \
       -v /path/to/certs:/certs:ro \
       -e GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
       -e GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your service account token> \
       grafana/mcp-grafana \
       -t streamable-http \
       -addr :8443 \
       --server.tls-cert-file /certs/server.crt \
       --server.tls-key-file /certs/server.key
     ```

   - **Download binary**: Download the latest release of `mcp-grafana` from the [releases page](https://github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana/releases) and place it in your `$PATH`.

   - **Build from source**: If you have a Go toolchain installed you can also build and install it from source, using the `GOBIN` environment variable
     to specify the directory where the binary should be installed. This should also be in your `PATH`.

     ```bash
     GOBIN="$HOME/go/bin" go install github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana/cmd/mcp-grafana@latest
     ```

   - **Deploy to Kubernetes using Helm**: use the [Helm chart from the Grafana helm-charts repository](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana-mcp)

     ```bash
     helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
     helm install --set grafana.apiKey=<Grafana_ApiKey> --set grafana.url=<GrafanaUrl> my-release grafana/grafana-mcp
     ```


3. Add the server configuration to your client configuration file. For example, for Claude Desktop:

   **If using uvx:**

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "grafana": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["mcp-grafana"],
         "env": {
           "GRAFANA_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
           "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "<your service account token>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **If using the binary:**

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "grafana": {
         "command": "mcp-grafana",
         "args": [],
         "env": {
           "GRAFANA_URL": "http://localhost:3000",  // Or "https://myinstance.grafana.net" for Grafana Cloud
           "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "<your service account token>",
           // If using username/password authentication
           "GRAFANA_USERNAME": "<your username>",
           "GRAFANA_PASSWORD": "<your password>",
           // Optional: specify organization ID for multi-org support
           "GRAFANA_ORG_ID": "1"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

> Note: if you see `Error: spawn mcp-grafana ENOENT` in Claude Desktop, you need to specify the full path to `mcp-grafana`.

**If using Docker:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "GRAFANA_URL",
        "-e",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN",
        "grafana/mcp-grafana",
        "-t",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "http://localhost:3000",  // Or "https://myinstance.grafana.net" for Grafana Cloud
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "<your service account token>",
        // If using username/password authentication
        "GRAFANA_USERNAME": "<your username>",
        "GRAFANA_PASSWORD": "<your password>",
        // Optional: specify organization ID for multi-org support
        "GRAFANA_ORG_ID": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: The `-t stdio` argument is essential here because it overrides the default SSE mode in the Docker image.

**Using VSCode with remote MCP server**

If you're using VSCode and running the MCP server in SSE mode (which is the default when using the Docker image without overriding the transport), make sure your `.vscode/settings.json` includes the following:

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "grafana": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

For HTTPS streamable HTTP mode with server TLS certificates:

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "grafana": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://localhost:8443/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Debug Mode

You can enable debug mode for the Grafana transport by adding the `-debug` flag to the command. This will provide detailed logging of HTTP requests and responses between the MCP server and the Grafana API, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.

To use debug mode with the Claude Desktop configuration, update your config as follows:

**If using the binary:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana": {
      "command": "mcp-grafana",
      "args": ["-debug"],
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "http://localhost:3000",  // Or "https://myinstance.grafana.net" for Grafana Cloud
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "<your service account token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**If using Docker:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "GRAFANA_URL",
        "-e",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN",
        "grafana/mcp-grafana",
        "-t",
        "stdio",
        "-debug"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "http://localhost:3000",  // Or "https://myinstance.grafana.net" for Grafana Cloud
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "<your service account token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: As with the standard configuration, the `-t stdio` argument is required to override the default SSE mode in the Docker image.

### TLS Configuration

If your Grafana instance is behind mTLS or requires custom TLS certificates, you can configure the MCP server to use custom certificates. The server supports the following TLS configuration options:

- `--tls-cert-file`: Path to TLS certificate file for client authentication
- `--tls-key-file`: Path to TLS private key file for client authentication
- `--tls-ca-file`: Path to TLS CA certificate file for server verification
- `--tls-skip-verify`: Skip TLS certificate verification (insecure, use only for testing)

**Example with client certificate authentication:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana": {
      "command": "mcp-grafana",
      "args": [
        "--tls-cert-file",
        "/path/to/client.crt",
        "--tls-key-file",
        "/path/to/client.key",
        "--tls-ca-file",
        "/path/to/ca.crt"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "https://secure-grafana.example.com",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "<your service account token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example with Docker:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "/path/to/certs:/certs:ro",
        "-e",
        "GRAFANA_URL",
        "-e",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN",
        "grafana/mcp-grafana",
        "-t",
        "stdio",
        "--tls-cert-file",
        "/certs/client.crt",
        "--tls-key-file",
        "/certs/client.key",
        "--tls-ca-file",
        "/certs/ca.crt"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "https://secure-grafana.example.com",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "<your service account token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The TLS configuration is applied to all HTTP clients used by the MCP server, including:

- The main Grafana OpenAPI client
- Prometheus datasource clients
- Loki datasource clients
- Incident management clients
- Sift investigation clients
- Alerting clients
- Asserts clients

**Direct CLI Usage Examples:**

For testing with self-signed certificates:

```bash
./mcp-grafana --tls-skip-verify -debug
```

With client certificate authentication:

```bash
./mcp-grafana \
  --tls-cert-file /path/to/client.crt \
  --tls-key-file /path/to/client.key \
  --tls-ca-file /path/to/ca.crt \
  -debug
```

With custom CA certificate only:

```bash
./mcp-grafana --tls-ca-file /path/to/ca.crt
```

**Programmatic Usage:**

If you're using this library programmatically, you can also create TLS-enabled context functions:

```go
// Using struct literals
tlsConfig := &mcpgrafana.TLSConfig{
    CertFile: "/path/to/client.crt",
    KeyFile:  "/path/to/client.key",
    CAFile:   "/path/to/ca.crt",
}
grafanaConfig := mcpgrafana.GrafanaConfig{
    Debug:     true,
    TLSConfig: tlsConfig,
}
contextFunc := mcpgrafana.ComposedStdioContextFunc(grafanaConfig)

// Or inline
grafanaConfig := mcpgrafana.GrafanaConfig{
    Debug: true,
    TLSConfig: &mcpgrafana.TLSConfig{
        CertFile: "/path/to/client.crt",
        KeyFile:  "/path/to/client.key",
        CAFile:   "/path/to/ca.crt",
    },
}
contextFunc := mcpgrafana.ComposedStdioContextFunc(grafanaConfig)
```

### Server TLS Configuration (Streamable HTTP Transport Only)

When using the streamable HTTP transport (`-t streamable-http`), you can configure the MCP server to serve HTTPS instead of HTTP. This is useful when you need to secure the connection between your MCP client and the server itself.

The server supports the following TLS configuration options for the streamable HTTP transport:

- `--server.tls-cert-file`: Path to TLS certificate file for server HTTPS (required for TLS)
- `--server.tls-key-file`: Path to TLS private key file for server HTTPS (required for TLS)

**Note**: These flags are completely separate from the client TLS flags documented above. The client TLS flags configure how the MCP server connects to Grafana, while these server TLS flags configure how clients connect to the MCP server when using streamable HTTP transport.

**Example with HTTPS streamable HTTP server:**

```bash
./mcp-grafana \
  -t streamable-http \
  --server.tls-cert-file /path/to/server.crt \
  --server.tls-key-file /path/to/server.key \
  -addr :8443
```

This would start the MCP server on HTTPS port 8443. Clients would then connect to `https://localhost:8443/` instead of `http://localhost:8000/`.

**Docker example with server TLS:**

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8443:8443 \
  -v /path/to/certs:/certs:ro \
  -e GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your service account token> \
  grafana/mcp-grafana \
  -t streamable-http \
  -addr :8443 \
  --server.tls-cert-file /certs/server.crt \
  --server.tls-key-file /certs/server.key
```

### Health Check Endpoint

When using the SSE (`-t sse`) or streamable HTTP (`-t streamable-http`) transports, the MCP server exposes a health check endpoint at `/healthz`. This endpoint can be used by load balancers, monitoring systems, or orchestration platforms to verify that the server is running and accepting connections.

**Endpoint:** `GET /healthz`

**Response:**
- Status Code: `200 OK`
- Body: `ok`

**Example usage:**

```bash
# For streamable HTTP or SSE transport on default port
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz

# With custom address
curl http://localhost:9090/healthz
```

**Note:** The health check endpoint is only available when using SSE or streamable HTTP transports. It is not available when using the stdio transport (`-t stdio`), as stdio does not expose an HTTP server.

### Observability

The MCP server supports Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry distributed tracing, following the [OTel MCP semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/mcp/).

#### Metrics

When using the SSE or streamable HTTP transports, enable Prometheus metrics with the `--metrics` flag:

```bash
# Metrics served on the main server at /metrics
./mcp-grafana -t streamable-http --metrics

# Metrics served on a separate address
./mcp-grafana -t streamable-http --metrics --metrics-address :9090
```

**Available Metrics:**

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `mcp_server_operation_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Duration of MCP operations (labels: `mcp_method_name`, `gen_ai_tool_name`, `error_type`, `network_transport`, `mcp_protocol_version`) |
| `mcp_server_session_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Duration of MCP client sessions (labels: `network_transport`, `mcp_protocol_version`) |
| `http_server_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Duration of HTTP server requests (from otelhttp) |

**Note:** Metrics are only available when using SSE or streamable HTTP transports. They are not available with the stdio transport.

#### Tracing

Distributed tracing is configured via standard `OTEL_*` environment variables and works independently of the `--metrics` flag. When `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set, the server exports traces via OTLP/gRPC:

```bash
# Send traces to a local Tempo instance
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true \
./mcp-grafana -t streamable-http

# Send traces to Grafana Cloud with authentication
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://tempo-us-central1.grafana.net:443 \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic ..." \
./mcp-grafana -t streamable-http
```

Tool call spans follow semconv naming (`tools/call <tool_name>`) and include attributes like `gen_ai.tool.name`, `mcp.method.name`, and `mcp.session.id`. The server also supports W3C trace context propagation from the `_meta` field of tool call requests.

**Docker example with metrics and tracing:**

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  -e GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your token> \
  -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://tempo:4317 \
  -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true \
  grafana/mcp-grafana \
  -t streamable-http --metrics
```

## Troubleshooting

### Grafana Version Compatibility

If you encounter the following error when using datasource-related tools:

```
get datasource by uid : [GET /datasources/uid/{uid}][400] getDataSourceByUidBadRequest {"message":"id is invalid"}
```

This typically indicates that you are using a Grafana version earlier than 9.0. The `/datasources/uid/{uid}` API endpoint was introduced in Grafana 9.0, and datasource operations will fail on earlier versions.

**Solution:** Upgrade your Grafana instance to version 9.0 or later to resolve this issue.

## Development

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.

This project is written in Go. Install Go following the instructions for your platform.

To run the server locally in STDIO mode (which is the default for local development), use:

```bash
make run
```

To run the server locally in SSE mode, use:

```bash
go run ./cmd/mcp-grafana --transport sse
```

You can also run the server using the SSE transport inside a custom built Docker image. Just like the published Docker image, this custom image's entrypoint defaults to SSE mode. To build the image, use:

```
make build-image
```

And to run the image in SSE mode (the default), use:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 mcp-grafana:latest
```

If you need to run it in STDIO mode instead, override the transport setting:

```
docker run -it --rm mcp-grafana:latest -t stdio
```

### Testing

There are three types of tests available:

1. Unit Tests (no external dependencies required):

```bash
make test-unit
```

You can also run unit tests with:

```bash
make test
```

2. Integration Tests (requires docker containers to be up and running):

```bash
make test-integration
```

3. Cloud Tests (requires cloud Grafana instance and credentials):

```bash
make test-cloud
```

> Note: Cloud tests are automatically configured in CI. For local development, you'll need to set up your own Grafana Cloud instance and credentials.

More comprehensive integration tests will require a Grafana instance to be running locally on port 3000; you can start one with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The integration tests can be run with:

```bash
make test-all
```

If you're adding more tools, please add integration tests for them. The existing tests should be a good starting point.

### Linting

To lint the code, run:

```bash
make lint
```

This includes a custom linter that checks for unescaped commas in `jsonschema` struct tags. The commas in `description` fields must be escaped with `\\,` to prevent silent truncation. You can run just this linter with:

```bash
make lint-jsonschema
```

See the [JSONSchema Linter documentation](internal/linter/jsonschema/README.md) for more details.
